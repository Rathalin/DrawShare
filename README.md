# DrawShare ![logo](https://github.com/Rhatalin/DrawShare/blob/master/GUI/Resources/DrawShareLogo_50.png "DrawShare Logo")

An application that let's you share your drawing in realtime

## Ussage

* Start the application by clicking on GUI.exe!
* Sharing over your local network works fine, but if you want to share your drawing over the internet, you need to enable port forwarding on your router.
  Every router interface is different but this may help you:

  - Protocol: TCP
  - WAN Host IP: 0.0.0.0
  - LAN Host IP Address: <local ipv4 address of your computer>
  - WAN Port: 59595
  - LAN Host Port: 59595
  
  If the router interface requires a range (eg. WAN Host IP Range) just type in the value twice:
  WAN Host IP Range: 0.0.0.0 ~ 0.0.0.0
